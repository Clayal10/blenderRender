# blenderRender

_blenderRender_ is a utility application for viewing 3d objects. The purpose of this application is for testing objects that I create for CS-392 in fall of 2025.

## Inputs

The program takes in an object file.

## Viewing

When viewing, the user will be able to move the object around, zoom in/out, and view it from any angle.
